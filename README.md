My experiment started with working on the Ethernet Configuration
So am working on the device with has Two Independent Ethernet Ports supported and we need to support below configuration profile
      1. Both Interfaces configuration with Static IP Address
      2. Both Interfaces supported with DHCP IP Address
      3. One with differnet DHCP/Statis and vice versa

So here we are going to discuss on the how to make this work and here am speaking on the problems that faced while working
Parallely sharing the links for our further deep understanding and how we fixed ths issue

In the same uploaded with the pdf file, which explains the Networking Concepts for better deep understanding on this
